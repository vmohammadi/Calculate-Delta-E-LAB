Calculating DELAB (CIEDELAB) and CIEDE2000 is essential in color science because these metrics provide a quantifiable assessment of color differences as perceived by the human eye. DELAB, based on the CIE Lab* color space, serves to evaluate color variations in a way that aligns more closely with human vision, accounting for factors such as luminance and chromaticity. DE2000, an advanced revision of DELAB, incorporates additional adjustments to better reflect perceptual uniformity and handle color discrepancies more accurately. These calculations are crucial in various applications, including quality control in manufacturing, color matching in design, and medical imaging, ensuring consistency and fidelity in color representation across different contexts. Understanding and accurately measuring color differences helps industries uphold standards and meet consumer expectations, affirming the significance of these calculations in color science.


# Calculate Delta ELAB (XYZ2DeltaElab.m)
The XYZ2DeltaElab function calculates the Delta E LAB (CIE76) color difference between two sets of XYZ color values, representing actual reflectance and predicted reflectance under specified illuminants and observers. It processes the input XYZ values to convert them into LAB color space using the CIE color matching functions and the specified illuminant, allowing for a perceptually relevant assessment of color differences. 

# Calculate Delta E 2000 (DE2000.m)
The DE2000 function computes the color difference between two LAB color representations: one derived from actual reflectance (Lab_r) and the other from predicted values (Lab_Pr). It implements the CIE Delta E 2000 formula, which incorporates parametric weighting factors 
KL,KC, and KH to adjust the impact of lightness, chroma, and hue differences on the perceived color difference. This function is essential for applications requiring precise color comparisons, such as in industries focused on color accuracy and consistency in design, manufacturing, and quality assurance.
